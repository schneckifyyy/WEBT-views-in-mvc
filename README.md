# WEBT-views-in-mvc
A test page for views in MVC where the page is rendered like using templating engines like fluid or Twig.
However, this page is rendered with string replacing the variables with regex in a String containing
HTML and echoing to the page with PHP.
Similiar to twig curly braces are used for placeholders (e.g. {{ hotel }}).
**Note: this is highly simplified and not well coded in terms of OOP as this is a school assignment to learn the concept of MVC**
